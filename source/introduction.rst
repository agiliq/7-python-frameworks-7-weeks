Introduction
-------------

A framework, is a platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new application.

A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of :code:`web applications` including :code:`web services`, :code:`web resources`, and :code:`web APIs`. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications. Web frameworks aim to :code:`automate` the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide :code:`libraries` for :code:`database` access, :code:`templating frameworks`, and :code:`session management`, and they often promote code reuse.
